  <p>
    (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Equity Financing</u></b
    >.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an Equity Financing before the expiration or
    termination of this instrument, the Company will automatically issue to the
    investor a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount
    divided by the Conversion Price.
  </p>
  <p>
    In connection with the issuance of Common Stock by the Company to the
    Investor pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Investor and the Company will
    execute a Pro Rata Rights Agreement, unless the Investor is already included
    in such rights in the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing.

    termination of this instrument, the Investor will, at its option, either (i)
    receive a cash payment equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the
    following paragraph) or (ii) automatically receive from the Company a number
    of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the
    Liquidity Price, if the Investor fails to select the cash option.
  </p>
  <p>
    In connection with Section (b)(i), the Purchase Amount will be due and
    payable by the Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent
    with, the consummation of the Liquidity Event. If there are not enough funds
    to pay the Investor and holders of other Safes (collectively, the "<b
      >Cash-Out Investors</b
    >") in full, then all of the Company's available funds will be distributed
    with equal priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion
    to their Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out Investors will automatically
    receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid
    Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price. In connection with a Change
    of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may
    reduce, pro rata, the Purchase Amounts payable to the Cash-Out Investors by
    the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith to be
    advisable for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in such case, the Cash-Out
    Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock
    equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity
